    <h3>THE TECH COMPANY'S ARE BEING HANDLED BY NATION'S TOP LEADERS AS GROUNDBREAKING AND FORWARD THINKING TO TECH IN THE FUTURE.</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: ADEYEMI KEHINDE </span>
    <p>Until recently, development on technology level of the world had been largely under the control of PRO'S developers. Coding activities have resulted in a good path for people on the path. Currently, the VerifyMe Nigeria regulating RegTech Compamy along with Walt Disney and has won several awards in TECH. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the RegTech Company.</p>

    <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay) was proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.</p>

    <p>The year was 2008 and the financial world was in chaos. Lehman Brothers had imploded, the federal government took over Fannie and Freddie, and money-market funds broke the buck. 
      The world was in the throes of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
      The federal government needed to revive the public’s trust in our financial institutions. That meant ushering in a new era of regulatory oversight.
      This new era was epitomized by one single and massive piece of legislation: the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act.
      Dodd-Frank would mark a sea of change in the world of regulatory compliance. Based on President Obama’s proposal for a “sweeping overhaul of the United States financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression,” Dodd-Frank was undeniably expansive and ambitious. But the success of the Act is more debatable. 
      To many, Dodd-Frank seemed like a half-measure that mended the proverbial fence only after the horse had escaped the corral. Many financial institutions saw it as overzealous and set on putting up unnecessary guardrails. To the public, it seemed disconnected from their desire to see big bank executives pay for the reckless behavior that had led to the financial crisis.
      Effective or not in its original intent, Dodd-Frank would mark a turning point in the industry: the moment the regulatory pendulum swung back from the under-regulated era pre-Global Financial Crisis to the over-regulated era that would follow.
      The massive tolls this new regulatory era has brought to bear on financial institutions is staggering.
      The Rise of AI
      Meanwhile, another tidal shift was beginning to disrupt nearly every vertical (though some much faster than others) — the rise of artificial intelligence.
      In the 2010s, AI began to develop extremely rapidly. Deep learning and neural networks made it possible to “teach” a system how to complete a task using a large data set of examples rather than through task-specific programming. 
      The distinction has wide-ranging implications. The process of writing a program is extremely labor-intensive. With deep learning, programmers can instead feed algorithms data sets to help them learn.</p>

    <p>According to RegTech Analyst, in 2015 there were 149 RegTech investment deals across the world, totaling $1.1 billion. Just four years later those numbers had jumped up to 317 deals totaling $8.5 billion.
      Those deals have continued to average larger and larger amounts. In 2015, only 3.4 percent of deals were valued at or over $50 million. By 2019, that percentage had shot up 17.3 percent of deals.
      This investment and maturation helped push RegTech solutions past pilots and out of the innovation phase, so that they could begin operationalizing benefits in a real-life environment. This, in turn, helped RegTech providers convince financial institutions that the value they now offered was real and meaningful.</p>
